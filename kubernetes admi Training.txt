Virtualization is a process that allows for more efficient use of physical computer hardware and is the foundation of cloud computing.
Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware, enabling the division of a single computer's hardware components—such as processors, 
memory and storage—into multiple virtual machines (VMs). Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, 
even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying computer hardware.


Containerization is a method of deploying and managing applications in the cloud by packaging them in isolated user spaces called containers12. 
Containers share the host system's operating system kernel, which reduces the overhead of running multiple guest operating systems3. 
Containers are portable and can run in any cloud or non-cloud environment, regardless of type or vendor24.
